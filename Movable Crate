/* 
  This hasn't been properly tested because I am unsure if using 2D or 3D. Currently this is 3D
  If the game uses 2D physics then change OnCollisionEnter(Collision col) to OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D col)
  GetKey means you have to hold the button down for it to work and it will release when you let go
  If you want to just press it change GetKey to GetKeyDown. Not sure if that will work as a toggle though.
  For now holding space down will work fine
